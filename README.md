# Rust Contracts for Gear.Tech

This repository contains **Rust-based smart contracts** developed as part of the Gear.Tech grant, utilizing the **Vara Blockchain**. These contracts provide functionality such as hash-time locked contracts (HTLC), order books, and price oracles.

## Contracts
- **HTLC**: Implements time-bound and hash-based transaction locking.
- **Orderbook**: Manages buy and sell orders in a decentralized marketplace.
- **Price Oracle**: Supplies price data for assets on-chain.

## Tech Stack
- **Rust**: For contract logic.
- **Vara Blockchain**: The blockchain platform powering the contracts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llilakoblock/rust-contracts.git
